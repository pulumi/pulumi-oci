The nodeId can be generated by assigning a unique id to each application dependency in the tree of application dependencies.

The preferred way of constructing a nodeId is to assign incremental integers during a breadth first or depth first search. A nodeId can be reused only it refers to the same subtree of application dependencies. (This is not equivalent to referring to the same GAV, that is, a GAV can have multiple transitive dependencies.)
