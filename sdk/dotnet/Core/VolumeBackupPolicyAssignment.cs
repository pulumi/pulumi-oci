    /// This resource provides the Volume Backup Policy Assignment resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Core service.
    /// 
    /// Assigns a volume backup policy to the specified volume or volume group. Note that a given volume or volume group can
    /// only have one backup policy assigned to it. If this operation is used for a volume or volume group that already
    /// has a different backup policy assigned, the prior backup policy will be silently unassigned.
    /// 
    /// ## Example Usage
    /// 
    /// ```csharp
    /// using System.Collections.Generic;
    /// using System.Linq;
    /// using Pulumi;
    /// using Oci = Pulumi.Oci;
    /// 
    /// return await Deployment.RunAsync(() =&gt; 
    /// {
    ///     var testVolumeBackupPolicyAssignment = new Oci.Core.VolumeBackupPolicyAssignment("test_volume_backup_policy_assignment", new()
    ///     {
    ///         AssetId = testVolume.Id,
    ///         PolicyId = testVolumeBackupPolicy.Id,
    ///         XrcKmsKeyId = testKey.Id,
    ///     });
    /// 
    /// });
    /// ```
    /// 
    /// ## Import
    /// 
    /// VolumeBackupPolicyAssignments can be imported using the `id`, e.g.
    /// 
    /// ```sh
    /// $ pulumi import oci:Core/volumeBackupPolicyAssignment:VolumeBackupPolicyAssignment test_volume_backup_policy_assignment "id"
