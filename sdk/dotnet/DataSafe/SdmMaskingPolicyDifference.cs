    /// This resource provides the Sdm Masking Policy Difference resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Safe service.
    /// 
    /// Creates SDM masking policy difference for the specified masking policy. It finds the difference between
    /// masking columns of the masking policy and sensitive columns of the SDM. After performing this operation,
    /// you can use ListDifferenceColumns to view the difference columns, PatchSdmMaskingPolicyDifferenceColumns
    /// to specify the action you want perform on these columns, and then ApplySdmMaskingPolicyDifference to process the
    /// difference columns and apply them to the masking policy.
    /// 
    /// ## Example Usage
    /// 
    /// &lt;!--Start PulumiCodeChooser --&gt;
    /// ```csharp
    /// using System.Collections.Generic;
    /// using System.Linq;
    /// using Pulumi;
