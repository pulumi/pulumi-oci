The Alarms feature of the Monitoring service interprets results for each returned time series as Boolean values, where zero represents false and a non-zero value represents true. A true value means that the trigger rule condition has been met. The query must specify a metric, statistic, interval, and trigger rule (threshold or absence). Supported values for interval: `1m`-`60m` (also `1h`). You can optionally specify dimensions and grouping functions. Supported grouping functions: `grouping()`, `groupBy()`.
