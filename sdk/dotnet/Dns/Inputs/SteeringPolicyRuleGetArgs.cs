When a rule has no sequence of `cases`, it is always evaluated with the same configuration during processing. When a rule has an empty sequence of `cases`, it is always ignored during processing. When a rule has a non-empty sequence of `cases`, its behavior during processing is configured by the first matching `case` in the sequence. When a rule has no matching cases the rule is ignored. A rule case with no `caseCondition` always matches. A rule case with a `caseCondition` matches only when that expression evaluates to true for the given query.
