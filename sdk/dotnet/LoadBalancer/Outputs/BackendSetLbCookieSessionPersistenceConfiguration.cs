If the `Domain` attribute in the `Set-cookie` header does not include the domain to which the original request was made, the client or browser might reject the cookie. As specified in RFC 6265, the client accepts a cookie with the `Domain` attribute value `example.com` or `www.example.com` sent from `www.example.com`. It does not accept a cookie with the `Domain` attribute `abc.example.com` or `www.abc.example.com` sent from `www.example.com`.
