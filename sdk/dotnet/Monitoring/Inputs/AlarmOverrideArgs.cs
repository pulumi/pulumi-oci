        /// (Updatable) The Monitoring Query Language (MQL) expression to evaluate for the alarm. The Alarms feature of the Monitoring service interprets results for each returned time series as Boolean values, where zero represents false and a non-zero value represents true. A true value means that the trigger rule condition has been met. The query must specify a metric, statistic, interval, and trigger rule (threshold or absence). Supported values for interval depend on the specified time range. More interval values are supported for smaller time ranges. You can optionally specify dimensions and grouping functions. Also, you can customize the  [absence detection period](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Monitoring/Tasks/create-edit-alarm-query-absence-detection-period.htm). Supported grouping functions: `grouping()`, `groupBy()`. For information about writing MQL expressions, see [Editing the MQL Expression for a Query](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Monitoring/Tasks/query-metric-mql.htm). For details about MQL, see [Monitoring Query Language (MQL) Reference](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Monitoring/Reference/mql.htm). For available dimensions, review the metric definition for the supported service. See [Supported Services](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Monitoring/Concepts/monitoringoverview.htm#SupportedServices).
