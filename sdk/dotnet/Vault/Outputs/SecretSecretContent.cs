A secret version that you mark as `PENDING` is staged and available for use, but you don't yet want to rotate it into current, active use. For example, you might create or update a secret and mark its rotation state as `PENDING` if you haven't yet updated the secret on the target system. When creating a secret, only the value `CURRENT` is applicable, although the value `LATEST` is also automatically applied. When updating a secret, you can specify a version's rotation state as either `CURRENT` or `PENDING`.
