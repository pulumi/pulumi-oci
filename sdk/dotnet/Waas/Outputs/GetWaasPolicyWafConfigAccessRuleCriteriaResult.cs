        /// * **URL_REGEX:** Matches if the concatenation of request URL path and query is described by the regular expression in the value field. The value must be a valid regular expression recognized by the PCRE library in Nginx (https://www.pcre.org).

        /// * **URL_PART_DOES_NOT_END_WITH:** Matches if the concatenation of request URL path and query does not end with the contents of the `value` field.
        /// * **IP_IS:** Matches if the request originates from one of the IP addresses contained in the defined address list. The `value` in this case is string with one or multiple IPs or CIDR notations separated by new line symbol \n *Example:* "1.1.1.1\n1.1.1.2\n1.2.2.1/30"

        /// * **HTTP_HEADER_CONTAINS:** The HTTP_HEADER_CONTAINS criteria is defined using a compound value separated by a colon: a header field name and a header field value. `host:test.example.com` is an example of a criteria value where `host` is the header field name and `test.example.com` is the header field value. A request matches when the header field name is a case insensitive match and the header field value is a case insensitive, substring match. *Example:* With a criteria value of `host:test.example.com`, where `host` is the name of the field and `test.example.com` is the value of the host field, a request with the header values, `Host: www.test.example.com` will match, where as a request with header values of `host: www.example.com` or `host: test.sub.example.com` will not match.
        /// * **HTTP_METHOD_IS:** Matches if the request method is identical to one of the values listed in field. The `value` in this case is string with one or multiple HTTP methods separated by new line symbol \n The list of available methods: `GET`, `HEAD`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `CONNECT`, `OPTIONS`, `TRACE`, `PATCH`
