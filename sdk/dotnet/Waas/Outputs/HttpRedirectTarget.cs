A static value must begin with a leading "/", optionally followed by other path characters. A request-copying value must exactly match "{path}", and will be replaced with the path component of the request URL (including its initial "/"). A request-prefixing value must start with "/" and end with a non-escaped "{path}", which will be replaced with the path component of the request URL (including its initial "/"). Only one such replacement token is allowed.
