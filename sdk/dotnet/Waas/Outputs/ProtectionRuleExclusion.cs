When the target is `ARGS`, the list may include strings of URL query parameters and values from form-urlencoded XML, JSON, AMP, or POST payloads to exclude from the protection rule. `Exclusions` properties must not contain whitespace, comma or |. **Note:** If protection rules have been enabled that utilize the `maxArgumentCount` or `maxTotalNameLengthOfArguments` properties, and the `target` property has been set to `ARGS`, it is important that the `exclusions` properties be defined to honor those protection rule settings in a consistent manner.
