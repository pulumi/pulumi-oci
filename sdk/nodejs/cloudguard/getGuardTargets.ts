/**
 * This data source provides the list of Targets in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Cloud Guard service.
 *
 * Returns a list of targets (TargetCollection resource with page of TargetSummary
 * resources) for the target identified by compartmentId. By default, only the target
 * associated with the compartment is returned. Setting compartmentIdInSubtree to true
 * returns the entire hierarchy of targets in subcompartments.
 *
 * The parameter `accessLevel` specifies whether to return only those compartments for which the
 * requestor has INSPECT permissions on at least one resource directly
 * or indirectly (ACCESSIBLE) (the resource can be in a subcompartment) or to return Not Authorized if
 * Principal doesn't have access to even one of the child compartments. This is valid only when
 * `compartmentIdInSubtree` is set to `true`.
 *
 * The parameter `compartmentIdInSubtree` applies when you perform ListTargets on the
 * `compartmentId` passed and when it is set to true, the entire hierarchy of compartments can be returned.
 * To get a full list of all targets in compartments and subcompartments in the tenancy (root compartment),
 * set the parameter `compartmentIdInSubtree` to true and `accessLevel` to ACCESSIBLE.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as oci from "@pulumi/oci";
 *
 * const testTargets = oci.CloudGuard.getGuardTargets({
 *     compartmentId: compartmentId,
 *     accessLevel: targetAccessLevel,
 *     compartmentIdInSubtree: targetCompartmentIdInSubtree,
 *     displayName: targetDisplayName,
 *     isNonSecurityZoneTargetsOnlyQuery: targetIsNonSecurityZoneTargetsOnlyQuery,
 *     state: targetState,
 * });
 * ```
