/**
 * This data source provides the list of Responder Recipes in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Cloud Guard service.
 *
 * Returns a list (ResponderRecipeCollection resource, with a page of ResponderRecipeSummary resources)
 * of all responder recipes (RespponderRecipe resources) in a compartment, identified by compartmentId.
 * The ListResponderRecipe operation returns only the targets in `compartmentId` passed.
 * The list does not include any subcompartments of the compartmentId passed.
 *
 * The parameter `accessLevel` specifies whether to return only those compartments for which the
 * requestor has INSPECT permissions on at least one resource directly
 * or indirectly (ACCESSIBLE) (the resource can be in a subcompartment) or to return Not Authorized if
 * Principal doesn't have access to even one of the child compartments. This is valid only when
 * `compartmentIdInSubtree` is set to `true`.
 *
 * The parameter `compartmentIdInSubtree` applies when you perform ListResponderRecipe on the
 * `compartmentId` passed and when it is set to true, the entire hierarchy of compartments can be returned.
 * To get a full list of all compartments and subcompartments in the tenancy (root compartment),
 * set the parameter `compartmentIdInSubtree` to true and `accessLevel` to ACCESSIBLE.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as oci from "@pulumi/oci";
 *
 * const testResponderRecipes = oci.CloudGuard.getResponderRecipes({
 *     compartmentId: compartmentId,
 *     accessLevel: responderRecipeAccessLevel,
 *     compartmentIdInSubtree: responderRecipeCompartmentIdInSubtree,
 *     displayName: responderRecipeDisplayName,
 *     resourceMetadataOnly: responderRecipeResourceMetadataOnly,
 *     state: responderRecipeState,
 * });
 * ```
