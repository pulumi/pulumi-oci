/**
 * This data source provides details about a specific Public Ip resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Core service.
 *
 * Gets the specified public IP. You must specify the object's [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm).
 *
 * Alternatively, you can get the object by using [GetPublicIpByIpAddress](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/PublicIp/GetPublicIpByIpAddress)
 * with the public IP address (for example, 203.0.113.2).
 *
 * Or you can use [GetPublicIpByPrivateIpId](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/PublicIp/GetPublicIpByPrivateIpId)
 * with the [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the private IP that the public IP is assigned to.
 *
 * **Note:** If you're fetching a reserved public IP that is in the process of being
 * moved to a different private IP, the service returns the public IP object with
 * `lifecycleState` = ASSIGNING and `assignedEntityId` = [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the target private IP.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Get a public ip by public ip id
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as oci from "@pulumi/oci";
 *
 * const testOciCorePublicIpById = oci.Core.getPublicIp({
 *     id: testPublicIpId,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ### Get a public ip by private ip id
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as oci from "@pulumi/oci";
 *
 * const testOciCorePublicIpByPrivateIpId = oci.Core.getPublicIp({
 *     privateIpId: testPublicIpPrivateIpId,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ### Get a public ip by public ip address
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as oci from "@pulumi/oci";
 *
 * const testOciCorePublicIpByIp = oci.Core.getPublicIp({
 *     ipAddress: testPublicIpIpAddress,
 * });
 * ```
