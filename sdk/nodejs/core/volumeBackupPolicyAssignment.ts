/**
 * This resource provides the Volume Backup Policy Assignment resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Core service.
 * Api doc link for the resource: https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/VolumeBackupPolicyAssignment
 *
 * Example terraform configs related to the resource : https://github.com/oracle/terraform-provider-oci/tree/master/examples/
 *
 * Assigns a volume backup policy to the specified volume or volume group. Note that a given volume or volume group can
 * only have one backup policy assigned to it. If this operation is used for a volume or volume group that already
 * has a different backup policy assigned, the prior backup policy will be silently unassigned.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as oci from "@pulumi/oci";
 *
 * const testVolumeBackupPolicyAssignment = new oci.core.VolumeBackupPolicyAssignment("test_volume_backup_policy_assignment", {
 *     assetId: testVolume.id,
 *     policyId: testVolumeBackupPolicy.id,
 *     xrcKmsKeyId: testKey.id,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * VolumeBackupPolicyAssignments can be imported using the `id`, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import oci:Core/volumeBackupPolicyAssignment:VolumeBackupPolicyAssignment test_volume_backup_policy_assignment "id"
 * ```
