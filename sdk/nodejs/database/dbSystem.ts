/**
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * DbSystems can be imported using the `id`, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import oci:Database/dbSystem:DbSystem test_db_system "id"
 * ```
 *
 * Import is only supported for source=NONE
 *
 * `db_home.0.database.0.admin_password` is not returned by the service for security reasons. To avoid a force new of the db_home on the next apply, add the following to the resource:
 *
 *     lifecycle {
 *     
 *         ignore_changes = ["db_home.0.database.0.admin_password"]
 *     
 *     }
 *
 * You may also need to add `hostname` to the ignore_changes list if you see a diff on a subsequent apply
 *
 * If the oci_database_db_system being imported is missing a primary db_home, an empty placeholder for `db_home` will be set in the Terraform state.
 *
 * To keep configurations consistent with the imported state, add an empty placeholder for `db_home` to your configuration like this:
 *
 * # Add this placeholder into your oci_database_db_system configuration to indicate that the primary db home is empty.
 *
 *   db_home {
 *
 *     database {
 *     
 *       admin_password = ""
 *     
 *     }
 *
 *   }
