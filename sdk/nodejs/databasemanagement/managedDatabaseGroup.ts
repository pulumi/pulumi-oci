/**
 * This resource provides the Managed Database Group resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Database Management service.
 *
 * Creates a Managed Database Group. The group does not contain any
 * Managed Databases when it is created, and they must be added later.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as oci from "@pulumi/oci";
 *
 * const testManagedDatabaseGroup = new oci.databasemanagement.ManagedDatabaseGroup("testManagedDatabaseGroup", {
 *     compartmentId: _var.compartment_id,
 *     description: _var.managed_database_group_description,
 *     managedDatabases: [{
 *         id: _var.managed_database_id,
 *     }],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * ManagedDatabaseGroups can be imported using the `id`, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import oci:DatabaseManagement/managedDatabaseGroup:ManagedDatabaseGroup test_managed_database_group "id"
 * ```
