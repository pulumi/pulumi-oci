/**
 * This resource provides the Discovery Job resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Safe service.
 *
 * Performs incremental data discovery for the specified sensitive data model. It uses the target database associated
 * with the sensitive data model.
 * After performing data discovery, you can use ListDiscoveryJobResults to view the discovery results, PatchDiscoveryJobResults
 * to specify the action you want perform on these results, and then ApplyDiscoveryJobResults to process the results
 * and apply them to the sensitive data model.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * <!--Start PulumiCodeChooser -->
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as oci from "@pulumi/oci";
 *
 * const testDiscoveryJob = new oci.datasafe.DiscoveryMod("testDiscoveryJob", {
 *     compartmentId: _var.compartment_id,
 *     sensitiveDataModelId: oci_data_safe_sensitive_data_model.test_sensitive_data_model.id,
 *     definedTags: {
 *         "Operations.CostCenter": "42",
 *     },
 *     discoveryType: _var.discovery_job_discovery_type,
 *     displayName: _var.discovery_job_display_name,
 *     freeformTags: {
 *         Department: "Finance",
 *     },
 *     isAppDefinedRelationDiscoveryEnabled: _var.discovery_job_is_app_defined_relation_discovery_enabled,
 *     isIncludeAllSchemas: _var.discovery_job_is_include_all_schemas,
 *     isIncludeAllSensitiveTypes: _var.discovery_job_is_include_all_sensitive_types,
 *     isSampleDataCollectionEnabled: _var.discovery_job_is_sample_data_collection_enabled,
 *     schemasForDiscoveries: _var.discovery_job_schemas_for_discovery,
 *     sensitiveTypeIdsForDiscoveries: _var.discovery_job_sensitive_type_ids_for_discovery,
 * });
 * ```
 * <!--End PulumiCodeChooser -->
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * DiscoveryJobs can be imported using the `id`, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import oci:DataSafe/discoveryMod:DiscoveryMod test_discovery_job "id"
 * ```
