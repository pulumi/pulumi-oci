/**
 * This data source provides details about a specific Alert Policy Rule resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Safe service.
 *
 * Lists the rules of the specified alert policy. The alert policy is said to be satisfied when all rules in the policy evaulate to true.
 * If there are three rules: rule1,rule2 and rule3, the policy is satisfied if rule1 AND rule2 AND rule3 is True.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as oci from "@pulumi/oci";
 *
 * const testAlertPolicyRule = oci.DataSafe.getAlertPolicyRule({
 *     alertPolicyId: oci_data_safe_alert_policy.test_alert_policy.id,
 * });
 * ```
