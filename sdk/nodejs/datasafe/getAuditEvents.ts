/**
 * This data source provides the list of Audit Events in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Safe service.
 *
 * The ListAuditEvents operation returns specified `compartmentId` audit Events only.
 * The list does not include any audit Events associated with the `subcompartments` of the specified `compartmentId`.
 *
 * The parameter `accessLevel` specifies whether to return only those compartments for which the
 * requestor has INSPECT permissions on at least one resource directly
 * or indirectly (ACCESSIBLE) (the resource can be in a subcompartment) or to return Not Authorized if
 * Principal doesn't have access to even one of the child compartments. This is valid only when
 * `compartmentIdInSubtree` is set to `true`.
 *
 * The parameter `compartmentIdInSubtree` applies when you perform ListAuditEvents on the
 * `compartmentId` passed and when it is set to true, the entire hierarchy of compartments can be returned.
 * To get a full list of all compartments and subcompartments in the tenancy (root compartment),
 * set the parameter `compartmentIdInSubtree` to true and `accessLevel` to ACCESSIBLE.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as oci from "@pulumi/oci";
 *
 * const testAuditEvents = oci.DataSafe.getAuditEvents({
 *     compartmentId: _var.compartment_id,
 *     accessLevel: _var.audit_event_access_level,
 *     compartmentIdInSubtree: _var.audit_event_compartment_id_in_subtree,
 *     scimQuery: _var.audit_event_scim_query,
 * });
 * ```
