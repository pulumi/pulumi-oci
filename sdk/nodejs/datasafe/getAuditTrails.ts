/**
 * This data source provides the list of Audit Trails in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Safe service.
 *
 * Gets a list of all audit trails.
 * The ListAuditTrails operation returns only the audit trails in the specified `compartmentId`.
 * The list does not include any subcompartments of the compartmentId passed.
 *
 * The parameter `accessLevel` specifies whether to return only those compartments for which the
 * requestor has INSPECT permissions on at least one resource directly
 * or indirectly (ACCESSIBLE) (the resource can be in a subcompartment) or to return Not Authorized if
 * Principal doesn't have access to even one of the child compartments. This is valid only when
 * `compartmentIdInSubtree` is set to `true`.
 *
 * The parameter `compartmentIdInSubtree` applies when you perform ListAuditTrails on the
 * `compartmentId` passed and when it is set to true, the entire hierarchy of compartments can be returned.
 * To get a full list of all compartments and subcompartments in the tenancy (root compartment),
 * set the parameter `compartmentIdInSubtree` to true and `accessLevel` to ACCESSIBLE.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as oci from "@pulumi/oci";
 *
 * const testAuditTrails = oci.DataSafe.getAuditTrails({
 *     compartmentId: compartmentId,
 *     accessLevel: auditTrailAccessLevel,
 *     auditTrailId: testAuditTrail.id,
 *     compartmentIdInSubtree: auditTrailCompartmentIdInSubtree,
 *     displayName: auditTrailDisplayName,
 *     state: auditTrailState,
 *     status: auditTrailStatus,
 *     targetDatabaseGroupId: testTargetDatabaseGroup.id,
 *     targetId: testTarget.id,
 * });
 * ```
