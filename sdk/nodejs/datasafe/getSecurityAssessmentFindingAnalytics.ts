/**
 * This data source provides the list of Security Assessment Finding Analytics in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Safe service.
 *
 * Gets a list of findings aggregated details in the specified compartment. This provides information about the overall state
 * of security assessment findings. You can use groupBy to get the count of findings under a certain risk level and with a certain findingKey,
 * and as well as get the list of the targets that match the condition.
 * This data is especially useful content for the statistic chart or to support analytics.
 *
 * When you perform the ListFindingAnalytics operation, if the parameter compartmentIdInSubtree is set to "true," and if the
 * parameter accessLevel is set to ACCESSIBLE, then the operation returns statistics from the compartments in which the requestor has INSPECT
 * permissions on at least one resource, directly or indirectly (in subcompartments). If the operation is performed at the
 * root compartment and the requestor does not have access to at least one subcompartment of the compartment specified by
 * compartmentId, then "Not Authorized" is returned.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as oci from "@pulumi/oci";
 *
 * const testSecurityAssessmentFindingAnalytics = oci.DataSafe.getSecurityAssessmentFindingAnalytics({
 *     compartmentId: compartmentId,
 *     accessLevel: securityAssessmentFindingAnalyticAccessLevel,
 *     compartmentIdInSubtree: securityAssessmentFindingAnalyticCompartmentIdInSubtree,
 *     findingKey: securityAssessmentFindingAnalyticFindingKey,
 *     groupBy: securityAssessmentFindingAnalyticGroupBy,
 *     isTopFinding: securityAssessmentFindingAnalyticIsTopFinding,
 *     severity: securityAssessmentFindingAnalyticSeverity,
 *     topFindingStatus: securityAssessmentFindingAnalyticTopFindingStatus,
 * });
 * ```
