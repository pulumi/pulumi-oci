/**
 * This data source provides the list of Security Assessment Template Association Analytics in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Safe service.
 *
 * Gets a list of template association details in the specified compartment. This provides information about the
 * overall template usage, by returning the count of the target databases/target groups using the templates.
 *
 * If the template baseline is created for a target group which contains several targets, we will have each individual target
 * listed there as targetId field together with targetDatabaseGroupId. And if the template baseline is created for an individual target,
 * it will have targetId field only.
 *
 * By leveraging the targetId filter, you will be able to know all the template or template baseline that this target has something to do with.
 * No matter if they are directly applied or created for this target, or they are for the target group the target belongs to.
 *
 * When you perform the ListTemplateAssociationAnalytics operation, if the parameter compartmentIdInSubtree is set to "true," and if the
 * parameter accessLevel is set to ACCESSIBLE, then the operation returns statistics from the compartments in which the requestor has INSPECT
 * permissions on at least one resource, directly or indirectly (in subcompartments). If the operation is performed at the
 * root compartment and the requestor does not have access to at least one subcompartment of the compartment specified by
 * compartmentId, then "Not Authorized" is returned.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as oci from "@pulumi/oci";
 *
 * const testSecurityAssessmentTemplateAssociationAnalytics = oci.DataSafe.getSecurityAssessmentTemplateAssociationAnalytics({
 *     compartmentId: compartmentId,
 *     accessLevel: securityAssessmentTemplateAssociationAnalyticAccessLevel,
 *     compartmentIdInSubtree: securityAssessmentTemplateAssociationAnalyticCompartmentIdInSubtree,
 *     targetDatabaseGroupId: testTargetDatabaseGroup.id,
 *     targetId: testTarget.id,
 *     templateAssessmentId: testTemplateAssessment.id,
 *     templateBaselineAssessmentId: testTemplateBaselineAssessment.id,
 * });
 * ```
