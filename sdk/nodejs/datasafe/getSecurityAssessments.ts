/**
 * This data source provides the list of Security Assessments in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Safe service.
 *
 * Gets a list of security assessments.
 *
 * The ListSecurityAssessments operation returns only the assessments in the specified `compartmentId`.
 * The list does not include any subcompartments of the compartmentId passed.
 *
 * The parameter `accessLevel` specifies whether to return only those compartments for which the
 * requestor has INSPECT permissions on at least one resource directly
 * or indirectly (ACCESSIBLE) (the resource can be in a subcompartment) or to return Not Authorized if
 * Principal doesn't have access to even one of the child compartments. This is valid only when
 * `compartmentIdInSubtree` is set to `true`.
 *
 * The parameter `compartmentIdInSubtree` applies when you perform ListSecurityAssessments on the
 * `compartmentId` passed and when it is set to true, the entire hierarchy of compartments can be returned.
 * To get a full list of all compartments and subcompartments in the tenancy (root compartment),
 * set the parameter `compartmentIdInSubtree` to true and `accessLevel` to ACCESSIBLE.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as oci from "@pulumi/oci";
 *
 * const testSecurityAssessments = oci.DataSafe.getSecurityAssessments({
 *     compartmentId: _var.compartment_id,
 *     accessLevel: _var.security_assessment_access_level,
 *     compartmentIdInSubtree: _var.security_assessment_compartment_id_in_subtree,

 *     scheduleAssessmentId: oci_data_safe_schedule_assessment.test_schedule_assessment.id,
 *     state: _var.security_assessment_state,
 *     targetId: oci_cloud_guard_target.test_target.id,
 *     timeCreatedGreaterThanOrEqualTo: _var.security_assessment_time_created_greater_than_or_equal_to,
 *     timeCreatedLessThan: _var.security_assessment_time_created_less_than,
 *     triggeredBy: _var.security_assessment_triggered_by,
 *     type: _var.security_assessment_type,
 * });
