/**
 * This resource provides the Security Assessment Finding resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Safe service.
 * Api doc link for the resource: https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/data-safe/latest/SecurityAssessmentFinding
 *
 * Example terraform configs related to the resource : https://github.com/oracle/terraform-provider-oci/tree/master/examples/datasafe
 *
 *   Patches one or more findings in the specified template baseline type security assessment. Use it to modify max allowed risk level in template baseline.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as oci from "@pulumi/oci";
 *
 * const testSecurityAssessmentFinding = new oci.datasafe.SecurityAssessmentFinding("test_security_assessment_finding", {
 *     securityAssessmentId: testSecurityAssessment.id,
 *     patchOperations: [{
 *         operation: securityAssessmentFindingPatchOperationsOperation,
 *         selection: securityAssessmentFindingPatchOperationsSelection,
 *         value: securityAssessmentFindingPatchOperationsValue,
 *     }],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * SecurityAssessmentFindings can be imported using the `id`, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import oci:DataSafe/securityAssessmentFinding:SecurityAssessmentFinding test_security_assessment_finding "securityAssessments/{securityAssessmentId}/findings"
 * ```
