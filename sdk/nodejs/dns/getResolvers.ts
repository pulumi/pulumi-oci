/**
 * This data source provides the list of Resolvers in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure DNS service.
 *
 * Gets a list of all resolvers within a compartment. The collection can
 * be filtered by display name, id, or lifecycle state. It can be sorted
 * on creation time or displayName both in ASC or DESC order. Note that
 * when no lifecycleState query parameter is provided, the collection
 * does not include resolvers in the DELETED lifecycleState to be consistent
 * with other operations of the API. Requires a `PRIVATE` scope query parameter.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * <!--Start PulumiCodeChooser -->
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as oci from "@pulumi/oci";
 *
 * const testResolvers = oci.Dns.getResolvers({
 *     compartmentId: _var.compartment_id,
 *     scope: "PRIVATE",
 *     displayName: _var.resolver_display_name,
 *     id: _var.resolver_id,
 *     state: _var.resolver_state,
 * });
