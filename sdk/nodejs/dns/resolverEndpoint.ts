/**
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as oci from "@pulumi/oci";
 *
 * const testResolverEndpoint = new oci.dns.ResolverEndpoint("test_resolver_endpoint", {
 *     isForwarding: resolverEndpointIsForwarding,
 *     isListening: resolverEndpointIsListening,
 *     name: resolverEndpointName,
 *     resolverId: testResolver.id,
 *     subnetId: testSubnet.id,
 *     scope: "PRIVATE",
 *     endpointType: resolverEndpointEndpointType,
 *     forwardingAddress: resolverEndpointForwardingAddress,
 *     listeningAddress: resolverEndpointListeningAddress,
 *     nsgIds: resolverEndpointNsgIds,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * For legacy ResolverEndpoints created without `scope`, these ResolverEndpoints can be imported using the `id`, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import oci:Dns/resolverEndpoint:ResolverEndpoint test_resolver_endpoint "resolverId/{resolverId}/name/{resolverEndpointName}"
 * ```
 * For ResolverEndpoints created using `scope`, these ResolverEndpoints can be imported using the `id`, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import oci:Dns/resolverEndpoint:ResolverEndpoint test_resolver_endpoint "resolverId/{resolverId}/name/{name}/scope/{scope}"
 * ```
