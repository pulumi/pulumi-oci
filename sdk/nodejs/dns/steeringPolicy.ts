/**
 * This resource provides the Steering Policy resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure DNS service.
 *
 * Creates a new steering policy in the specified compartment. For more information on
 * creating policies with templates, see [Traffic Management API Guide](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/TrafficManagement/Concepts/trafficmanagementapi.htm).
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as oci from "@pulumi/oci";
 *
 * const testSteeringPolicy = new oci.dns.SteeringPolicy("test_steering_policy", {
 *     compartmentId: compartmentId,
 *     displayName: steeringPolicyDisplayName,
 *     template: steeringPolicyTemplate,
 *     answers: [{
 *         name: steeringPolicyAnswersName,
 *         rdata: steeringPolicyAnswersRdata,
 *         rtype: steeringPolicyAnswersRtype,
 *         isDisabled: steeringPolicyAnswersIsDisabled,
 *         pool: steeringPolicyAnswersPool,
 *     }],
 *     definedTags: steeringPolicyDefinedTags,
 *     freeformTags: steeringPolicyFreeformTags,
 *     healthCheckMonitorId: testHttpMonitor.id,
 *     rules: [{
 *         ruleType: steeringPolicyRulesRuleType,
 *         cases: [{
 *             answerDatas: [{
 *                 answerCondition: steeringPolicyRulesCasesAnswerDataAnswerCondition,
 *                 shouldKeep: steeringPolicyRulesCasesAnswerDataShouldKeep,
 *                 value: steeringPolicyRulesCasesAnswerDataValue,
 *             }],
 *             caseCondition: steeringPolicyRulesCasesCaseCondition,
 *             count: steeringPolicyRulesCasesCount,
 *         }],
 *         defaultAnswerDatas: [{
 *             answerCondition: steeringPolicyRulesDefaultAnswerDataAnswerCondition,
 *             shouldKeep: steeringPolicyRulesDefaultAnswerDataShouldKeep,
 *             value: steeringPolicyRulesDefaultAnswerDataValue,
 *         }],
 *         defaultCount: steeringPolicyRulesDefaultCount,
 *         description: steeringPolicyRulesDescription,
 *     }],
 *     ttl: steeringPolicyTtl,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * SteeringPolicies can be imported using the `id`, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import oci:Dns/steeringPolicy:SteeringPolicy test_steering_policy "id"
 * ```

     * * `LOAD_BALANCE` - Distributes web traffic to specified endpoints based on defined weights.

     * * `ROUTE_BY_ASN` - Answers DNS queries based on the query's originating ASN.
