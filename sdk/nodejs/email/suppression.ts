/**
 * This resource provides the Suppression resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Email service.
 *
 * Adds recipient email addresses to the suppression list for a tenancy.
 * Addresses added to the suppression list via the API are denoted as
 * "MANUAL" in the `reason` field. *Note:* All email addresses added to the
 * suppression list are normalized to include only lowercase letters.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * <!--Start PulumiCodeChooser -->
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as oci from "@pulumi/oci";
 *
 * const testSuppression = new oci.email.Suppression("testSuppression", {
 *     compartmentId: _var.tenancy_ocid,
 *     emailAddress: _var.suppression_email_address,
 * });
 * ```
 * <!--End PulumiCodeChooser -->
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Suppressions can be imported using the `id`, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import oci:Email/suppression:Suppression test_suppression "id"
 * ```
