/**
 * This data source provides the list of Compartments in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Identity service.
 *
 * Lists the compartments in a specified compartment. The members of the list
 * returned depends on the values set for several parameters.
 *
 * With the exception of the tenancy (root compartment), the ListCompartments operation
 * returns only the first-level child compartments in the parent compartment specified in
 * `compartmentId`. The list does not include any subcompartments of the child
 * compartments (grandchildren).
 *
 * The parameter `accessLevel` specifies whether to return only those compartments for which the
 * requestor has INSPECT permissions on at least one resource directly
 * or indirectly (the resource can be in a subcompartment).
 *
 * The parameter `compartmentIdInSubtree` applies only when you perform ListCompartments on the
 * tenancy (root compartment). When set to true, the entire hierarchy of compartments can be returned.
 * To get a full list of all compartments and subcompartments in the tenancy (root compartment),
 * set the parameter `compartmentIdInSubtree` to true and `accessLevel` to ANY.
 *
 * See [Where to Get the Tenancy's OCID and User's OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm#five).
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * <!--Start PulumiCodeChooser -->
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as oci from "@pulumi/oci";
 *
 * const testCompartments = oci.Identity.getCompartments({
 *     compartmentId: _var.compartment_id,
