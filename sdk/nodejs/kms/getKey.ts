/**
 * This data source provides details about a specific Key resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Kms service.
 *
 * Gets information about the specified master encryption key.
 *
 * As a management operation, this call is subject to a Key Management limit that applies to the total number
 * of requests across all management read operations. Key Management might throttle this call to reject an
 * otherwise valid request when the total rate of management read operations exceeds 10 requests per second for
 * a given tenancy.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as oci from "@pulumi/oci";
 *
 * const testKey = oci.Kms.getKey({
 *     keyId: oci_kms_key.test_key.id,
 *     managementEndpoint: _var.key_management_endpoint,
 * });
 * ```
