/**
 * This data source provides the list of Keys in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Kms service.
 *
 * Lists the master encryption keys in the specified vault and compartment.
 *
 * As a management operation, this call is subject to a Key Management limit that applies to the total number
 * of requests across all management read operations. Key Management might throttle this call to reject an
 * otherwise valid request when the total rate of management read operations exceeds 10 requests per second
 * for a given tenancy.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as oci from "@pulumi/oci";
 *
 * const testKeys = oci.Kms.getKeys({
 *     compartmentId: _var.compartment_id,
 *     managementEndpoint: _var.key_management_endpoint,
 *     algorithm: _var.key_algorithm,
 *     length: _var.key_length,
 *     curveId: oci_kms_curve.test_curve.id,
 *     protectionMode: _var.key_protection_mode,
 * });
 * ```
