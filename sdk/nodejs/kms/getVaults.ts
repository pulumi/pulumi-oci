/**
 * This data source provides the list of Vaults in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Kms service.
 *
 * Lists the vaults in the specified compartment.
 *
 * As a provisioning operation, this call is subject to a Key Management limit that applies to
 * the total number of requests across all provisioning read operations. Key Management might
 * throttle this call to reject an otherwise valid request when the total rate of provisioning
 * read operations exceeds 10 requests per second for a given tenancy.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as oci from "@pulumi/oci";
 *
 * const testVaults = oci.Kms.getVaults({
 *     compartmentId: compartmentId,
 * });
