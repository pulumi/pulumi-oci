/**
 * This resource provides the Management Dashboards Import resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Management Dashboard service.
 * Api doc link for the resource: https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/managementdashboard/latest/ManagementDashboardsImport
 *
 * Example terraform configs related to the resource : https://github.com/oracle/terraform-provider-oci/tree/master/examples/management_dashboard
 *
 * Imports an array of dashboards and their saved searches.
 * Here's an example of how you can use CLI to import a dashboard. For information on the details that must be passed to IMPORT, you can use the EXPORT API to obtain the Import.json file:
 * `oci management-dashboard dashboard export --query data --export-dashboard-id "{\"dashboardIds\":[\"ocid1.managementdashboard.oc1..dashboardId1\"]}"  > Import.json`.
 * Note that import API updates the resource if it already exists, and creates a new resource if it does not exist. To import to a different compartment, edit and change the compartmentId to the desired compartment OCID.
 * Here's an example of how you can use CLI to import:
 * `oci management-dashboard dashboard import --from-json file://Import.json`
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as oci from "@pulumi/oci";
 *
 * const testManagementDashboardsImport = new oci.managementdashboard.ManagementDashboardsImport("test_management_dashboards_import", {
 *     overrideDashboardCompartmentOcid: managementDashboardsImportOverrideDashboardCompartmentOcid,
 *     overrideSameName: managementDashboardsImportOverrideSameName,
 *     overrideSavedSearchCompartmentOcid: managementDashboardsImportOverrideSavedSearchCompartmentOcid,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * ManagementDashboardsImport can be imported using the `id`, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import oci:ManagementDashboard/managementDashboardsImport:ManagementDashboardsImport test_management_dashboards_import "id"
 * ```
