/**
 * This data source provides details about a specific Alarm resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Monitoring service.
 *
 * Gets the specified alarm.
 * For more information, see
 * [Getting an Alarm](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Monitoring/Tasks/get-alarm.htm).
 * For important limits information, see
 * [Limits on Monitoring](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Monitoring/Concepts/monitoringoverview.htm#limits).

 * This call is subject to a Monitoring limit that applies to the total number of requests across all alarm operations.
 * Monitoring might throttle this call to reject an otherwise valid request when the total rate of alarm operations exceeds 10 requests,

 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript

 * import * as oci from "@pulumi/oci";
 *
 * const testAlarm = oci.Monitoring.getAlarm({
 *     alarmId: testAlarmOciMonitoringAlarm.id,
