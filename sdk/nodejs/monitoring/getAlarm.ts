/**
 * This data source provides details about a specific Alarm resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Monitoring service.
 *
 * Gets the specified alarm.
 * For more information, see
 * [Getting an Alarm](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Monitoring/Tasks/get-alarm.htm).
 * For important limits information, see
 * [Limits on Monitoring](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Monitoring/Concepts/monitoringoverview.htm#limits).
 *
 * This call is subject to a Monitoring limit that applies to the total number of requests across all alarm operations.
 * Monitoring might throttle this call to reject an otherwise valid request when the total rate of alarm operations exceeds 10 requests,
 * or transactions, per second (TPS) for a given tenancy.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as oci from "@pulumi/oci";
 *
 * const testAlarm = oci.Monitoring.getAlarm({
 *     alarmId: oci_monitoring_alarm.test_alarm.id,
 * });
 * ```
