/**
 * This resource provides the Network Firewall Policy Security Rule resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Network Firewall service.
 * Api doc link for the resource: https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/network-firewall/latest/NetworkFirewallPolicySecurityRule
 *
 * Example terraform configs related to the resource : https://github.com/oracle/terraform-provider-oci/tree/master/examples/network_firewall
 *
 * Creates a new Security Rule for the Network Firewall Policy.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as oci from "@pulumi/oci";
 *
 * const testNetworkFirewallPolicySecurityRule = new oci.networkfirewall.NetworkFirewallPolicySecurityRule("test_network_firewall_policy_security_rule", {
 *     action: networkFirewallPolicySecurityRuleAction,
 *     name: networkFirewallPolicySecurityRuleName,
 *     condition: {
 *         applications: networkFirewallPolicySecurityRuleConditionApplication,
 *         destinationAddresses: networkFirewallPolicySecurityRuleConditionDestinationAddress,
 *         services: networkFirewallPolicySecurityRuleConditionService,
 *         sourceAddresses: networkFirewallPolicySecurityRuleConditionSourceAddress,
 *         urls: networkFirewallPolicySecurityRuleConditionUrl,
 *     },
 *     networkFirewallPolicyId: testNetworkFirewallPolicy.id,
 *     inspection: networkFirewallPolicySecurityRuleInspection,
 *     positions: [{
 *         afterRule: networkFirewallPolicySecurityRulePositionAfterRule,
 *         beforeRule: networkFirewallPolicySecurityRulePositionBeforeRule,
 *     }],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * NetworkFirewallPolicySecurityRules can be imported using the `name`, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import oci:NetworkFirewall/networkFirewallPolicySecurityRule:NetworkFirewallPolicySecurityRule test_network_firewall_policy_security_rule "networkFirewallPolicies/{networkFirewallPolicyId}/securityRules/{securityRuleName}"
 * ```
