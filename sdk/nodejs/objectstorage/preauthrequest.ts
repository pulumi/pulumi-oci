/**
 * This resource provides the Preauthenticated Request resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage service.
 * Api doc link for the resource: https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/objectstorage/latest/PreauthenticatedRequest
 *
 * Example terraform configs related to the resource : https://github.com/oracle/terraform-provider-oci/tree/master/examples/
 *
 * Creates a pre-authenticated request specific to the bucket.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as oci from "@pulumi/oci";
 *
 * const testPreauthenticatedRequest = new oci.objectstorage.Preauthrequest("test_preauthenticated_request", {
 *     accessType: preauthenticatedRequestAccessType,
 *     bucket: preauthenticatedRequestBucket,
 *     name: preauthenticatedRequestName,
 *     namespace: preauthenticatedRequestNamespace,
 *     timeExpires: preauthenticatedRequestTimeExpires,
 *     bucketListingAction: preauthenticatedRequestBucketListingAction,
 *     object: preauthenticatedRequestObject,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * PreauthenticatedRequests can be imported using the `id`, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import oci:ObjectStorage/preauthrequest:Preauthrequest test_preauthenticated_request "n/{namespaceName}/b/{bucketName}/p/{parId}"
 * ```
