/**
 * This data source provides the list of Managed Instance Module Streams in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure OS Management service.
 *
 * Retrieve a list of module streams, along with a summary of their
 * status, from a managed instance.  Filters may be applied to select
 * a subset of module streams based on the filter criteria.
 *
 * The 'moduleName' attribute filters against the name of a module.
 * It accepts strings of the format "<module>".  If this attribute
 * is defined, only streams that belong to the specified module are
 * included in the result set.  If it is not defined, the request is
 * not subject to this filter.
 *
 * The "status" attribute filters against the state of a module stream.
 * Valid values are "ENABLED", "DISABLED", and "ACTIVE".  If the
 * attribute is set to "ENABLED", only module streams that are enabled
 * are included in the result set.  If the attribute is set to "DISABLED",
 * only module streams that are not enabled are included in the result
 * set.  If the attribute is set to "ACTIVE", only module streams that
 * are active are included in the result set.  If the attribute is not
 * defined, the request is not subject to this filter.
 *
 * When sorting by the display name, the result set is sorted first
 * by the module name and then by the stream name.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as oci from "@pulumi/oci";
 *
 * const testManagedInstanceModuleStreams = oci.OsManagement.getManagedInstanceModuleStreams({
 *     managedInstanceId: _var.managed_instance_id,
 *     compartmentId: _var.compartment_id,
 *     moduleName: _var.managed_instance_module_name,
 *     streamName: _var.managed_instance_module_stream_name,
 *     streamStatus: _var.managed_instance_module_stream_status,
 * });
