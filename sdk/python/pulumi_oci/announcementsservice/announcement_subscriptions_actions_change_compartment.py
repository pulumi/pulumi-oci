        This resource provides the Announcement Subscriptions Actions Change Compartment resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Announcements Service service.

        Moves the specified announcement subscription from one compartment to another compartment. When provided, If-Match is checked against ETag values of the resource.

        This call is subject to an Announcements limit that applies to the total number of requests across all read or write operations. Announcements might throttle this call to reject an otherwise valid request when the total rate of operations exceeds 20 requests per second for a given user. The service might also throttle this call to reject an otherwise valid request when the total rate of operations exceeds 100 requests per second for a given tenancy.

        ## Example Usage

        ```python
        import pulumi
        import pulumi_oci as oci

        test_announcement_subscriptions_actions_change_compartment = oci.announcements_service.AnnouncementSubscriptionsActionsChangeCompartment("test_announcement_subscriptions_actions_change_compartment",
