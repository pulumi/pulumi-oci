    This data source provides the list of Compartments in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Identity service.

    Lists the compartments in a specified compartment. The members of the list
    returned depends on the values set for several parameters.

    With the exception of the tenancy (root compartment), the ListCompartments operation
    returns only the first-level child compartments in the parent compartment specified in
    `compartmentId`. The list does not include any subcompartments of the child
    compartments (grandchildren).

    The parameter `accessLevel` specifies whether to return only those compartments for which the
    requestor has INSPECT permissions on at least one resource directly
    or indirectly (the resource can be in a subcompartment).

    The parameter `compartmentIdInSubtree` applies only when you perform ListCompartments on the
    tenancy (root compartment). When set to true, the entire hierarchy of compartments can be returned.
    To get a full list of all compartments and subcompartments in the tenancy (root compartment),
    set the parameter `compartmentIdInSubtree` to true and `accessLevel` to ANY.

    :param str compartment_id: The OCID of the compartment (remember that the tenancy is simply the root compartment).
    :param bool compartment_id_in_subtree: Default is false. Can only be set to true when performing ListCompartments on the tenancy (root compartment). When set to true, the hierarchy of compartments is traversed and all compartments and subcompartments in the tenancy are returned depending on the the setting of `accessLevel`.
    :param str name: A filter to only return resources that match the given name exactly.
